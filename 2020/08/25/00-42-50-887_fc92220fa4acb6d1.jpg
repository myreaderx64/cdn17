		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">In their excellent <em>Angrynomics</em> Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan recommend that the government borrows at negative yields to establish a sovereign wealth fund. There’s more to be said for this than they think, because the UK is better situated than many countries to have such a fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My chart shows why. It shows that sterling tends to fall when house <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/about/house-price-index/download-data#xtab:uk-series">prices</a> do. In the mid-90s, 2008, 2011 and last year weakness in the housing market was accompanied by a weak pound. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95e583a200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hp£" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95e583a200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95e583a200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Hp£" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, I’m using house prices here as a proxy for something more general – bad times for the UK economy generally. &#0160;The chart therefore tells us that a UK-based investor makes a profit on foreign currency assets when the UK economy faces hard times. Although house prices didn’t fall then, the Brexit referendum in &#0160;2016 is another datapoint in support of this hypothesis: the markdown in UK growth expectations was accompanied by a markdown in sterling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn’t merely because demand for sterling depends upon actual and expected economic activity. It’s also because sterling is regarded by global investors as a riskier currency than dollars, euros or Swiss francs -&#0160; which means that in hard times, when risk aversion increases, they dump sterling. This is why sterling fell during the worst of the stock market falls this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This means that for the UK a SWF could be a countercyclical asset. In recessions a falling pound would mitigate losses on overseas equities and generate profits on gold, overseas bonds and foreign currency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year’s experience demonstrates this. In the day job I showed that a <a href="https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/comment/2020/04/02/simplicity-works/">simple</a> portfolio of dollars, gold, global equities cash and gilts would have lost barely anything during the worst of this year’s stock market falls even with half its money in equities – thanks to profits on gold and dollars. Slightly more cautious portfolios would have risen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because a UK SWF would hold up in bad times it can be a counter-cyclical device. Payments from the fund could be raised (slightly) in hard times without greatly jeopardizing its long-run returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Better still, it needs no skill to achieve this. The weights in my portfolio were based on no more than reasonable round numbers. That vindicates a point made by the LBS’s Victor DeMiguel, that naïve diversification works <a href="http://faculty.london.edu/avmiguel/DeMiguel-Garlappi-Uppal-RFS.pdf">well (pdf)</a> (which itself is a specific instance of Robyn Dawes <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190386677.pdf">point (pdf)</a> that there is a “robust beauty” in improper linear models.) We don’t therefore need a genius to run the fund. All we need is a mediocrity with a plausible manner to lend it authority. And the UK has an abundant supply of mediocrities with plausible manners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, though, I fear this oversells a SWF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One problem is that it will come under political pressure to invest domestically and to bail out struggling UK firms rather than to diversify internationally. I’m not sure Eric and Mark are selling an SWF when they <a href="https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/beyond-bailouts">suggest</a> it bails out UK airlines. For the SWF, that should be a pure investment decision not a political one. If you think UK firms are starved of finance – and I’m not at all sure airlines would be exhibit A for this hypothesis - the solution is a national investment bank, not a SWF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A second problem is that a SWF that was sufficiently cautiously managed to hold up in bad times would under-perform or lose money in good. Logically, this is no problem at all. One of the basic principles of financial economics is that what matters is your portfolio as a whole. If the SWF loses money when our other assets are doing well – our human capital and domestic businesses – there is therefore no problem. Quite the opposite: the SWF is doing exactly what it should.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, however, economic logic and the media are not often even nodding acquaintances. We can see this from today’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53859299">reports</a> of UK government borrowing, which reveal an utter ignorance of the basic facts that balance sheets have two sides and that one person’s debt is another’s asset. The moment the SWF loses money – which of course even the best funds do sometimes – the idiotmedia will run stories of the “scandal” of “taxpayers’” money being wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a portfolio management point of view, running a SWF is easy. From a political point of view, it is not.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Would Labour have handled the A level fiasco better than the Tories? There’s a reason to think so, and it has nothing to do with the parties’ relative competence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, it’s because Labour ministers would have had different sensibilities, or sympathies. They would have been more awake than the Tories to the situation of 18-year-olds from poor schools and hence more alert to developments which might hurt them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point here is a Smithian one. Smith <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/smith-the-theory-of-moral-sentiments-and-on-the-origins-of-languages-stewart-ed">thought</a> that sympathy “arise[s] from an imaginary change of situations with the person principally concerned.” But, as Smith saw, our imagination is limited. It’s easier to put yourself in someone’s shoes if you have actually been in them, or if you have friends or family in those shoes, or if you expect to be in them later. Although there are many exceptions on either side, Labour MPs therefore sympathize more with people from poor backgrounds whilst Tories are more likely to sympathize with landlords, bankers or bosses. For this reason, some sections of capital would have disproportionate influence over a Tory government even if not a single pound changed hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not that capital wants to leave it at that. It’s the principle of sympathy that justifies JP Morgan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53817905">hiring</a> Sajid Javid. Politicians around the world will look at that and think “that could be me”. This feat of imagination will increase their sympathies with bankers. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be40a2b41200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Smith" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e2026be40a2b41200d img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be40a2b41200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Smith" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obvious as it seems, this Smithian idea explains a lot. It explains why some people sympathize more with migrants than others. If you feel an outsider in the UK – say because of your race, class, sexuality or just idiosyncratic temperament – you’ll find it easier to put yourselves in the shoes of those who feel compelled to leave their country. Logically, rightist lovers of freedom should support freedom of movement as much as leftists. But differences in sympathies mean that in fact things are otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also explains why so many on the left had misgivings about New Labour, even though it did much to help working people such as introducing the minimum wage and tax credits. There was a feeling that its sympathies lay <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2009/02/brown-betrayed-by-bankers.html">more</a> with bosses and bankers than with working people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also explains the long-running electoral success of the Tories. Their sympathies make them instinctively more likely to placate enough of the rich and powerful to earn a reputation for competence. Nobody gives a damn if your policies hurt single parents in Wigan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is why it matters that top jobs are dominated by people from private schools. Because we all find it easier to sympathize with people like us, the dominance of the privately educated therefore skews decision-making (not least in the media) towards the interests of the rich and against those of the poor. And this would be the case even if the decision-makers were honest and of good will.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this both justifies representative democracy and helps explain why it goes wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Voters aren’t qualified to judge the technical competence of the parties, nor even their detailed policies – not even in aggregate, given that the conditions required for the wisdom of crowds are absent. What they can do, though, is say which set of sympathies they prefer. And that&#39;s reasonable. In politics there is an agency problem - the danger that the government won&#39;t act in our interests. Knowing that its sympathies are in line with our own, however, reduces this risk.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Differences in sympathies, however, can also help explain some of the bigger policy failures of our times. Thatcher’s introduction of the poll tax arose from not sympathizing with people who didn’t own property. The occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan might have been less disastrous if New Labour had better sympathy with military men, and wouldn&#39;t have occurred at all if Blair had more sympathy for working people and less for George Bush. The introduction of Universal Credit would have gone better had there been sympathy for benefit recipients. And so on up to the A level mess.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which brings us to a problem. The greater are divisions within a society, the harder it is for one side to sympathize with the other. Which means that policy errors are more likely. As long ago as 1995 Patrick Dunleavy <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Dunleavy/publication/249827627_Policy_Disasters_Explaining_the_UK&#39;s_Record/links/5b4cc79445851507a7a5a6b4/Policy-Disasters-Explaining-the-UKs-Record.pdf">argued (pdf)</a> that the UK was “unusually prone to make large-scale, avoidable policy mistakes” – a point confirmed by Ivor Crewe and Anthony King in <em>The Blunders of our Governments</em> and of course corroborated by subsequent events. Which poses the question. Might it be that this unusual proneness to error arises in part from our deep class <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/03/on-class-difference.html">divisions</a>*? If so, then good technocratic government actually requires the abolition of those divisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* Dunleavy, Crewe and King offer more proximate explanations for bad government. But at least one of these - overconfidence - is most certainly a <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2017/02/class-confidence.html">class</a> issue.</em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The A levels U-turn has prompted the question: what went <a href="https://www.ft.com/video/282ecd1f-8402-4bf4-8ee7-3d179ce5fcc2">wrong</a> with the algorithm?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is: nothing, zip, diddly, jack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What went wrong wasn’t the equation, but people. People create algorithms and they do so according to the principle garbage in, garbage out. The error here was not of high-level maths. It was a basic failure to appreciate the nature of statistics. Statistics cannot discover what isn’t there. And the information we really needed – how to compare students across schools – just wasn’t there. As the great Dan Davies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/15/a-level-results-system-ofqual-england-exam-marking">puts</a> it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No statistical method in the world is going to be able to give you good results if the information you’re looking for is fundamentally not there in the dataset that you’re trying to extract it from</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem wasn’t the algo. It was that the people in charge of it combined stupidity with class hatred. And it is of course not good enough for Williamson to <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/exams-u-turn-williamson-bats-resignation-talk">claim</a> that “Ofqual didn&#39;t deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place.” Ofqual isn’t some organic food company delivering a strange-looking vegetable. It is, or should be, under government control. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95d8328200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Fuckalgo" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95d8328200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95d8328200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Fuckalgo" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on here is in fact an old and widespread error. Its what Georg Lukacs <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/">called</a> reification – the process whereby “a relation between people takes on the character of a thing”. What actually happened was that people in power allocated A level results. That’s a relation between people. But to some, this relation appears as a thing, an algorithm. Which effaces the basic fact that those in power are the enemy of young working class people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With algorithms and big data <a href="https://novaramedia.com/2020/08/17/fuck-the-algorithm-how-a-level-students-have-shown-future-of-protest/">becoming</a> increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">important</a>, the danger is that the reification <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">fallacy</a> will increasingly serve as a means of effacing the reality of class power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, of course, it has done so for decades. When Luddites smashed machines, they were transferring their anger from people to things – just as people do today when they rail against IT systems failures rather than against the mismanagement that create them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in 1845, Marx <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/abstract.htm">described</a> how capitalism appears to people not as the product of human action but rather as “an alien power existing outside them, of the origin and goal of which they are ignorant, which they are no longer able to control.” Of course, this does not mean that specific individuals are always to blame as they are in the A level case: often, social outcomes are emergent, the product of human action but not human design. Nevertheless, they are human-made.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic example of this reification is how some people use the phrase “market forces” to defend income inequality. What this misses is that “the market” is not some entity existing above us but is really only a <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2017/07/the-ideology-of-the-market.html">relation</a> between people. And it is a relation of power. As Rick <a href="https://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/high-pay-what-is-to-be-done/">said</a>, “all pay is, ultimately, a function of power.” Bosses and bankers have power; they must be bribed not to misappropriate their firms’ assets. But care-workers do not – often <a href="https://developingeconomics.org/2020/04/02/time-for-a-rethink-on-the-worth-of-work/">because</a> they are women and migrants who lack outside options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this, of course matters for the reason Marx thought it did. If we regard inequalities and inefficiencies as arising from abstractions – be they algos or market forces – we are apt to either attack the wrong target or, worse still, to resign ourselves to fate. We need not do either. Technology - which includes social technologies such as markets - is a human construct.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">News items this week have highlighted an under-appreciated political division – between issues that involve clear harm to identifiable individuals and those that don’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrast the crime* that is the mishandling of A levels with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/11/bbc-and-sky-accused-of-dehumanising-people-trying-to-cross-channel">reports</a> of migrants crossing the channel in dinghies. There’s a massive difference between the two. The mis-<a href="https://dmac1988.wordpress.com/2020/08/14/a-level-results-2020/">marking</a> of A levels imposes real suffering <a href="https://twitter.com/RottenEggs1618/status/1294383452863836161">upon</a> identifiable <a href="https://twitter.com/CaitMurray9/status/1294323324588380162">people</a>. But a few migrants in dinghies do not: even if you believe – <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/02/immigrants-as-scapegoats.html">wrongly</a> – that immigration cuts wages and jobs, it is not the few desperate people who arrive in boats that are doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latter – what Chris Grey <a href="https://chrisgreybrexitblog.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-sillier-season.html">calls</a> an “artificial emergency” - is not the only example of reified, unempirical politics that is unconcerned with real material harm. The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53482895">reports</a> on record government borrowing without pointing to a single individual who is suffering because of it. Claims that borrowing imposes a burden on future generations miss the point that government borrowing is also an <a href="https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2019/04/20/is-public-debt-really-a-burden-on-future-generations/">asset</a> for some people, and that such borrowing bequeaths assets to future generations in the form of better infrastructure and education, and by preventing the loss of businesses and skills that would occur if borrowing were not so high. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be409045e200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Bbcmigrant" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e2026be409045e200d img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be409045e200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Bbcmigrant" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, even the more articulate Brexiters often fail to point to a material harm done by being in the EU or a material benefit from leaving, preferring to speak of windy abstractions such as sovereignty. Of course, the EU like all human institutions has its faults, but leaving on account of its fisheries policy is like jumping out of a plane because you don’t like the in-flight meal. And if you really want to boost UK exports, there are countless <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/08/the-trade-deal-fetish.html">better</a> ways to do so than trying to negotiate new trade deals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are serious examples of unempirical politics, but there are unserious ones too. At a time when thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, futures and even lives because of government incompetence, the Times saw fit yesterday to run a piece <a href="https://twitter.com/MattChorley/status/1294537446286331904">fantasising</a> about a Labour government nationalizing Marx and Spencer (ooh, my sides are splitting).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compare all this to empirical people-based politics. Issues such as poverty, the inadequate benefits system, excess deaths from Covid-19, mass job losses and a decade of wage stagnation all involve real material suffering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This division between the politics of empirical suffering and the politics of fantasy and abstraction overlaps to a large extent with the left-right divide. In recent years much of the left has focused upon the empirical harms of poverty and austerity whilst the right has been obsessed with sovereignty and “control of our borders.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From one perspective, this is an odd inversion. Those of us formed in the 70s were told that conservatism was an empirical tendency concerned with the amelioration of identifiable evils whilst the left had abstract utopian visions. Here, for example, is <a href="https://bbs.pku.edu.cn/attach/85/e2/85e2c8b439bfb4da/On">Oakeshott (pdf)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The conservative] thinks that an innovation which is a response to some specific defect, one designed to redress some specific disequilibrium, is more desirable than one which springs from a notion of a generally improved condition of human circumstances, and is far more desirable than one generated by a vision of perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By this standard, it is the left that is conservative, worried about specific defects of poverty and the mismanagement of the exam system whilst it is the right that has a “vision of perfection”, a vision of perfect sovereignty and controllable borders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;In this divide, the BBC – let alone the rest of the media - horribly fails to maintain due impartiality. Imagine the mass media didn’t exist so your only knowledge of political issues came from the personal experience of you and your family, friends and neighbours. How would politics appear to you?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, empirical issues would loom large. You would know people who hadn’t had a real pay rise for years; had missed a top university place; or was worried about their job or business. Most of you wouldn’t, though, feel any material harm from being in the EU and would not know a few dozen migrants were crossing the channel. In drawing our attention to the latter and diverting us from the former, the media biases us against empirical politics. “Due impartiality” is not merely a matter of how the BBC reports particular issues. It is about what it chooses to report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But why has this left-right division between empirical and unempirical politics emerged? It’s a relatively recent development. Thatcher, for example, attempted to solve genuine problems such as inflation and our poor economic performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally, I doubt that it’s because rightists suffered a bang on the head all at the same time. Instead, I suspect it is because extractive rentier capitalism <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/05/technocrats-class.html">precludes</a> – to a greater extent than used to be the case – remedies for specific defects. Which means that fantasy politics is all the right have got.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* I say “crime” because three unforgiveable errors are involved: the class war that has seen students from poor backgrounds hit hard; the fundamental <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/15/a-level-results-system-ofqual-england-exam-marking">misunderstanding</a> of statistics (no method can uncover information that’s just not there); and the failure to appreciate that there was an obvious <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/08/limits-of-radicalism.html">solution</a>.</em></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year, Dominic Cummings <a href="https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/">appealed</a> for &quot;more genuine cognitive diversity&quot; in government, wanting to hire &quot;true wild cards&quot; and weirdos. The A level results which have <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/35-of-a-level-results-downgraded-by-one-grade-figures-reveal-12048251">seen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1293862670001737728">talented</a> students <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/13/england-a-level-downgrades-hit-pupils-from-disadvantaged-areas-hardest">punished</a> for <a href="https://dmac1988.wordpress.com/2020/08/14/a-level-results-2020/">being</a> poor shows that he has not yet achieved that ambition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I say this because there was in principle an obvious solution. The government should have adopted a version of the Texas 10 per cent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_Bill_588">rule</a>, which requires that the top 10 per cent of students from each school be admitted to Texan state universities. Adapting this to the English case would have meant asking schools to give A* grades to the best 8.9% of students in each subject, A grades to the next 18.7% and so on (I&#39;ve used these numbers to match this year&#39;s <a href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/Alevel/Outcomes_Link2/">distribution</a> of grades.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such a system would have had six great advantages. It would have avoided the problem of trying to compare students across schools in the absence of public exams. It would have been more transparent than this year&#39;s effort at standardization. It would have prevented grade inflation, as the proportion of grades could have been determined in advance. It has a proven track record: it has worked well enough in Texas for years. It would have ensured that grades were determined by those who most knew what they were doing. As Ofqual itself <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/909368/6656-1_Awarding_GCSE__AS__A_level__advanced_extension_awards_and_extended_project_qualifications_in_summer_2020_-_interim_report.pdf">says (pdf)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best judges of the relative ability of students in a school or college were the teachers who had been preparing these students... we know from research evidence that people are better at making relative judgements than absolute judgements and that teachers’ judgements tend to be more accurate when they are ranking students rather than estimating their future attainment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it would have embodied a principle of equality of opportunity, as it would reward students for their own efforts and abilities and not have punished them for going to poor-performing schools. Although John Roemer best <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674004221">articulated</a> this principle, it is also a Thatcherite one: she <a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/104335">wanted</a> &quot;a land in which individuals will have a fair chance, by their own efforts, of winning happiness&quot;. The Texas rule fulfils this aim better than an algorithm which punishes people for their background.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sure, there would have been a few issues: how to treat borderline cases, or schools where very few students sat some subjects. But these issues are surely minor compared to those afflicting the current system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which poses the question: why was this method not even discussed (at least in public)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ignorance is no excuse: I was <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2004/11/a_texan_offa.html">writing</a> about the Texas rule 16 years ago, and anybody who knows less than me is utterly unqualified for any position of authority.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, it&#39;s because it challenges the class system in two ways. For one thing, it would require the government to respect the judgement of teachers and to treat them as professionals rather than proletarian objects of managerialism. And more importantly, such a rule would advantage bright people from poor schools and penalize mediocre ones from posh schools - which would undermine the point of the UK class system*. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95caf1b200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Sadie" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95caf1b200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e95caf1b200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Sadie" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What all this shows is that Cummings&#39; radicalism is if not fake then at least limited. Cognitive diversity and weirdness must stop at the point when it challenges class privilege.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, Cummings is not alone here. There&#39;s a long tradition of posh people pretending to be radical, up to the point at which their own privilege is challenged. George Orwell (not perhaps a wholly reliable witness) <a href="https://www.george-orwell.org/The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier/10.html">wrote</a> in 1937:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The typical Socialist is not, as tremulous old ladies imagine, a ferocious-looking working man with greasy overalls and a raucous voice. He is either a youthful snob-Bolshevik who in five years&#39; time will quite probably have made a wealthy marriage and been converted to Roman Catholicism; or, still more typically, a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with a social position which he has no intention of forfeiting...most middle-class Socialists, while theoretically pining for a class-less society, cling like glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mutatis mutandis, we see similar things nowadays. Greg Dyke <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jan/08/uknews1%20">called</a> the BBC &quot;hideously white&quot; <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/ourbeeb/still-hideously-white/">without</a> actually solving the problem. &quot;Satirists&quot; mocked the government but shat their pants when presented with a mildly social democratic alternative. Class tourists think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkpLbEM06qE">poor</a> is cool. We see it too in woke <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/08/on-woke-capitalism.html">capitalists</a>; in Guardian types who think that &quot;cool and edgy&quot; are terms of praise rather than indicators of unutterable kack; in some leftists who favour crank conspiracy theories over proper class analysis; and in celebs who profess to be green whilst using private jets. And this is not to mention the slightly different but equally long tradition of &quot;angry young men&quot; of the 50s, &quot;hip young gunslingers&quot; of the 70s or RCPers of the 80s becoming tiresome reactionaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cummings&#39; radical posture is therefore part of a long and widespread tendency. What&#39;s going on here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The question gains force from an intellectual tradition - associated with Burke and Oakeshott - which has linked political conservatism (preserving inequality) with cognitive conservatism (scepticism about the power of rationality). If you&#39;re benefiting from the system, why rock the boat? The cognitive biases programme should, in principle, have reinforced this link by teaching us of the tight limits of our abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, why do we so often see those with a vested interest in preserving class hierarchies profess a form of radicalism? There are countless possible explanations, among them daddy issues and the tendency for posh schooling to inculcate the <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2017/02/class-confidence.html">over-confident</a> belief that one knows better than the wisdom of ages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But there is a kinder explanation. Actually-existing British capitalism is unjust and inefficient. The smarter and better beneficiaries of the system recognise this. Yes, doing so whilst retaining class privilege makes them hypocrites, but hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* It would, of course, be unfair to characterize this government as comprising posh mediocrities. Many of them cannot even aspire to the dizzy heights of mediocrity.</em></p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because you are an idiot doesn&#39;t mean you are always wrong. So it is with James Cleverly&#39;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/12/uk-minister-james-cleverly-attacks-ben-jerrys-virtue-signalling-on-refugees">denunciation</a> of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s &quot;virtue-signalling&quot; after the company spoke out against the government&#39;s ill-treatment of migrants.</p>

Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s fine words contrast with the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/25/ben-jerrys-migrant-workers-dairy-farms">reluctance</a> to improve the rights of its own workers until it came under huge pressure to do so - thereby demonstrating the truth of Marx&#39;s claim that &quot;capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society.&quot; <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde896c3f200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="StarbucksGay" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde896c3f200c img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde896c3f200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="StarbucksGay" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But of course, Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s are not alone in their hypocrisy. Amazon (among many other companies) has spoken in <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1267140211861073927">support</a> of Black Live Matter despite being a notoriously bad employer. Facebook and Twitter bosses have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/technology/facebook-youtube-twitter-black-lives-matter.html?action=click&amp;module=Well&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=Technology">supported</a> BLM whilst allowing race hate speech on their sites. Starbucks <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2019/starbucks-pride-a-long-legacy-of-lgbtq-inclusion/">enthusiasm</a> for being &quot;an ally to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community&quot; is matched by its enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/27/starbucks-emea-pays-183m-tax-but-348m-in-royalty-payments">avoiding</a> tax. And as Sarah O&#39;Connor <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/48e02694-a54c-4cec-9af6-ada8b4955e20">points</a> out, several &quot;sustainable&quot; fund managers are better at PR than at actually forcing improvements in working conditions. And so on and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/blackwashing-corporations-woke-capitalism-protests">Blackwashing</a> is the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing">greenwashing</a>. Luke Savage is right. What we&#39;re seeing here is &quot;the <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/06/brands-corporate-publicity-racial-justice">commodification</a> of social justice&quot; - using virtue-signalling to shift more product. Sometimes, the twin <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/11/shoring-up-capitalism.html">goals</a> of capitalism - raising profits and trying to legitimate the system - happen to coincide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of which poses the question: is &quot;woke capitalism&quot; feasible or even desirable?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly, capitalism has historically been associated with patriarchy, racism and slavery - although the <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/08/how-slavery-shaped-american-capitalism">contribution</a> of the <a href="https://economic-historian.com/2020/08/slavery-and-capitalism-a-discussion-with-caitlin-rosenthal-tom-cutterham-and-eric-hilt/">latter</a> to capitalism is still a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/slavery-capitalism.html">matter</a> of <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2020/07/slavery-and-history-of-us-economic.html">debate</a>. But of course, so too have been other modes of production. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The question is: are racism and sexism inherent features of capitalism? </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two reasons to suspect so. One is that racism fulfils a useful function by dividing the working class and promoting national identity at the expense of class consciousness: Tory and media attempts to stir up anti-migrant feeling whilst employment is collapsing is just the latest example of this. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other is that in capitalism those with little bargaining power lose out relative to others - which means that women and migrant workers often get a raw deal. In this context, the idea that sexism and racism could be eliminated if only capitalists were more woke is a mistake. Some <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/06/racism-as-emergence.html">injustices</a> arise from <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2014/06/patriarchy-as-an-emergent-process.html">emergent</a> processes independent of intentions. As Marx <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm#S5">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[The fate of the worker] does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granted, some have been more optimistic about these external coercive laws. Gary Becker, for example, thought that competition could <a href="https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2008/09/competitive-markets-and-discrimination-against-minorities-becker.html">eliminate</a> discrimination - although it seems it is yet to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/ethnicitypaygapsingreatbritain/2018">actually</a> do so. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#39;s assume, however, that all this is wrong and that capitalism could be woke, in the sense that there were no gender or ethnic pay gaps, that women and minorities were as likely to achieve prominent positions as white men, and that there was no racism or sexism in the workplace. What then?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, every criticism Marx made of capitalism would still be on the table. Marx did not criticise capitalism because of its racism and sexism* - a fact that has historically led some Marxists to understate the importance of these. Instead, his complaints were that it was <a href="http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj79/cox.htm">alienating</a>, <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/">oppressive</a>, a force for inequalities in wealth and power, and prone to crises and <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/03/on-capitalist-stagnation.html">stagnation</a>. The fact that capitalism currently works to the disproportionate benefit of mediocre white men is but one of its flaws. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, you can deny the force of these criticisms. But the point is that Marx&#39;s critique of capitalism is independent of racism and sexism. Even if we had the most perfectly woke capitalism, Marxists would find huge problems with the system. (I think rightly, but that&#39;s by the by.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of which is to endorse Helen Lewis&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/07/cancel-culture-and-problem-woke-capitalism/614086/">point</a>, that there&#39;s a big difference between social and economic radicalism. Some - maybe many - capitalists might be the former, perhaps sincerely. But they are not the latter. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* With the caveat that the process of primitive <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm">accumulation</a> was often accompanied by racism.</em> </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, the humane thing to do is also economically efficient, and this government is doing neither. This is the message of today’s employment <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/august2020">numbers</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We must not be fooled by the fact that unemployment, at 1.34 million, fell slightly in the second quarter and is unchanged from a year ago. This disguises huge job losses. PAYE <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/august2020">data</a> show that the number of employees fell by 740,000 between February and July. And as the furlough scheme is withdrawn, further job losses are likely. On top of this, the numbers of self-employed slumped by 238,000 in Q2, <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be407a61b200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Iawantjob" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e2026be407a61b200d img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026be407a61b200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Iawantjob" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, why didn’t unemployment rise? One reason is that there have been lots of jobs lost among the over-65s: 161,000 in Q2. Many of these will have returned to retirement. The number of people who are economically inactive but would like a job rose by 218,000 in the quarter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A second reason is that it is foreigners who have lost jobs: the number of non-UK people in work fell by 327,000 in Q2. Some of these will have gone home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of which poses a danger – that the economy has lost potential supply. Some of those migrant workers (and perhaps some of the over-65s) might not return to the UK if or when labour demand picks up. The formerly self-employed might decide that self-employment is too precarious for them and so seek staff jobs instead. That will cause shortages for those industries (such as much of the entertainment business) dependent upon the flexibility that freelancers offer. And to the extent that small businesses close, their surviving rivals will enjoy greater monopoly and pricing power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we get a decent recovery in demand, therefore, it might stoke up inflation. Not very much inflation, granted. But enough to limit the expansion somewhat. What should have been a temporary shock might therefore have longer-lasting adverse effects upon potential growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a policy failure. In theory, the government could have preserved the economy in aspic when we went into lockdown thus protecting all jobs and businesses, taking it out only when the threat of Covid-19 passed. It did not do so. Instead, as James Smith at the Resolution Foundation says, the support was <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/comment/sunaks-crisis-fighting-measures-time-to-scale-up/">inadequate</a> and – as Paul Evans notes – insufficiently <a href="https://reaction.life/the-creative-sector-is-going-to-need-a-marshall-plan-to-recover-from-covid-19/">targeted</a> at freelancers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which poses the question. Why has policy failed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t think the main reason was concern about horizontal equity – paying people to do nothing is unfair on those still working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suspect a stronger reason was insufficient intellectual flexibility. The Tories aversion to massive intervention in markets is reasonable in normal times but inappropriate in a crisis when the pandemic prevents normal market functioning*. They failed to make a big enough shift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, there has been a lack of policy infrastructure. What we most needed back in March was immediate and massive support for everybody. But as Eric has <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/policy-response-updated0/">pointed</a> out, the systems were not in place for this. And whilst there were possible ways of working around this – as Eric has shown - both the Bank and the Treasury weren’t sufficiently intellectually agile to adopt such methods. &#0160;One lesson of this crisis is that the government should put the infrastructure in place to ameliorate the next downturn – so that a basic income, job guarantee or helicopter money can be swiftly introduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the greatest reason for the failure, however, is that the government (and media) make a fetish of the public finances. Even Faisal Islam – who should know better – has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52819591">said</a> that the furlough scheme is “being paid by the taxpayer.” You don’t need to believe MMT to see this is not quite right. The cost&#0160;of supporting jobs need not and should not be borne by current taxpayers. The government can borrow over decades and so spread the cost not only to our grandchildren but to their grandchildren too: It’s only a few years ago that the government paid off the fiscal cost of the Napoleonic <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/94653f60-60e8-11e4-894b-00144feabdc0">war</a>. Better still, this cost falls over time. 25-year gilts now yield minus three per cent in real terms, which means that for every £100 the government borrows today it need repay less than £50 in today’s money over the next quarter-century.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I’m even ball-park right that today’s losses of jobs and businesses will reduce future capacity, and that they are due in part to the fiscal fetish, we have a nice irony – that an attachment to “sound money” might prove to be inflationary. In policy-making, intentions and outcomes are sometimes different things. &#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* I say pandemic rather than lockdown because, as Sweden’s fall in GDP shows, Covid-19 would have reduced economic activity even without a lockdown simply by scaring people out of shops and offices.</em></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">“The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recent news seems to vindicate <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm">Marx’s</a> <a href="https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2019/02/marxs-ideas-about-government.html">aphorism</a>. Today, Robert Jenrick <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53669432">relaxed</a> planning laws a few months after seeing big <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/exclusive-property-tycoons-gave-tories-more-than-11m-in-less-than-a-year/">donations</a> to the Tories from property companies. This is of a pattern with his giving planning permission for a development by Richard Desmond soon after Mr Desmond made a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-53172995">donation</a> to the Tory party. Support for jobs and businesses is being used to pay <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7jxvn/corporations-receiving-bailout-billions-have-laid-off-staff-and-paid-investors">dividends</a> and big CEO salaries. And an advisor to Liz Truss made <a href="https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1291244082145177600">millions</a> from selling unusable PPE to the NHS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, Marx was right. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde87f24e200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Dypolun" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde87f24e200c img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e2026bde87f24e200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Dypolun" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not so fast. My chart tells another story. It shows that there is a decent correlation (0.48 since data began in 1998) between the dividend yield on the All-share index and UK political uncertainty, as <a href="https://www.policyuncertainty.com/">measured</a> by Baker. Bloom and Davis*. Greater political uncertainty means lower share prices. The Brexit referendum, and uncertainty about the terms of our exit last year, greatly depressed share prices. In creating political uncertainty – much more so than under most of the Labour government – the Tories have costs capitalists billions. And with uncertainty still well above its long-run average, this cost is ongoing.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can we reconcile this with Marx’s claim?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One possibility is that it shows that the state has a degree of autonomy. It does not mechanistically always do the bidding of capital.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another answer is that the government is not the same as the state. The government comprises damn fools who do all sorts of silly things. But essential functions of the state do serve capital’s interests – for example, in providing infrastructure, skilled (and quiescent!) workers, protection of property rights and economic stabilizers to mitigate recessions.&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But there’s something else. Although capital has some common interests, it also has conflicting ones: bankers versus manufacturers; small businesses versus monopolies; landlords <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/04/why-rent-matters.html">versus</a> retailers. And so on. The interests this government is best serving are not those of productive capital. Whilst it is cutting red tape for property developers it is imposing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fbc6f191-6d69-4dcb-b374-0fa6e48a9a1e">billions</a> of pounds of it onto road hauliers and exporters. And whilst the lockdown is jeopardizing countless smaller businesses, the government is protecting banks and landlords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is, then, promoting the interests of <a href="http://groupelavigne.free.fr/christophers19.pdf">rentiers (pdf)</a> and spivs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which poses questions. Does this tell us about the character of this government, that it should align itself with shysters? Or does it instead tell us something about the nature of British capital – that its most regressive elements are those that are now most dominant?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* The correlation is far stronger between the yield and global policy uncertainty, where the latter has been raised significantly by the Orange Cretin.</em></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Katharine Birbalsingh, headteacher of Michaela Community School, says the Black Lives Matter movement is a distraction. I think her claim is defensible – albeit because it raises an issue many of us would rather ignore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Times quotes her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with getting angry about racism is it’s distracting. It leaves you with less energy to help you succeed, like working hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This alerts us to a nasty conflict – between beliefs that are true and those that are useful. It is true that black people face discrimination: for example, the ONS <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/ethnicitypaygapsingreatbritain/2018">says</a> that Black Britons earn 7.7 per cent less than their white counterparts even controlling for factors such as qualifications and occupation. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2c0bb3200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Althusser" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2c0bb3200c img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2c0bb3200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Althusser" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Telling Black pupils this is, however, not necessarily useful. It might demotivate them. Better instead to tell them that they can succeed if they work hard. Sure, even if they do so they’ll face tougher lives than their white counterparts: they’ll be less well-paid, more likely to be harassed by the police and more likely to face abuse, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/2017/09/we-tracked-25688-abusive-tweets-sent-women-mps-half-were-directed-diane-abbott">especially</a> if they are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/09/labour-mp-dawn-butler-closes-office-after-receiving-racist-threats">women</a> in the public eye. But it is likely that - on average - they’ll have better lives if they take Ms Birbalsingh’s advice than if they don’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sense, Ms Birbalsingh is right. Racism is indeed distracting. Telling pupils about it is to tell the truth. But not all truths are helpful. We have a dilemma: do we tell young people the truth, or do we equip them to improve their lives? As Hayek put it in 1976:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is...a real dilemma to what extent we ought to encourage in the young the belief that when they really try they will succeed, or should rather emphasize that inevitably some unworthy will succeed and some worthy fail. (<em>Law, Legislation and Liberty</em>, vol II, p74 in my copy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This conflict between truth and utility isn’t, of course, confined to what we tell children. We see it in other contexts. For example, people who overestimate their abilities are more <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5zz0q2r0">likely</a> to get good jobs than those with more truthful assessments of their skills. This doesn’t always benefit them at the expense of the rest of us. It can sometimes be a social good, as Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We probably would have few novelists, actors or scientists if all potential aspirants to those careers took action based on a normatively justifiable probability of success. We might also have few new products, new medical procedures, new political movements or new scientific theories. (<em>Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, whilst many of you might think religious belief false, it is <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/grapaoner/06_2f03.htm">useful</a> in the double sense of making people happier and more resilient in the face of bad fortune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And as Donald Davidson wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both self-deception and wishful thinking are often benign. It is neither surprising nor on the whole bad that people think better of their friends and families than a clear-eyed survey of the evidence would justify. Learning is probably more often encouraged than not by parents and teachers who over-rate the intelligence of their wards. Spouses often keep things on an even keel by ignoring or overlooking the lipstick on the collar. (&quot;Deception and division&quot;, in Jon Elster (ed),&#0160;<em>The Multiple Self</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Untruths, then, can be useful in many contexts. Ms Birbalsingh’s attitude to racism is thus justifiable – at least for someone in her position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, but, but. Isn’t the purpose of education to tell people the truth? The truth, as Rawls said, is the first virtue of systems of thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such a view is naïve. In a capitalist society, the function of schools is not primarily to impart rationality and knowledge. It is to <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2007/04/ideological_sta.html">habituate</a> pupils into the ways of capitalism. Schools are, as Louis Althusser said, part of the ideological state <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm">apparatus</a>. Within this function, talk of racism is indeed a distraction.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Duncan Weldon made a good point recently when he <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/1288564488329994242">tweeted</a> that the “disconnect between British political discourse and opinion of mainstream economic opinion feels extreme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whilst political discourse talks of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/28/rishi-sunak-conservative-civil-war-austerity-tax-rise">balancing</a> the government’s books, most economists (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed87a02d-539e-40c4-9f85-d70b726833c2">outside</a> the IFS) point to negative borrowing costs and think it more important to look after the economy. Instead, whether left or right, we have other priorities: how might monetary policy better support the economy? How can we end the long stagnation in productivity? Why are house prices so high and what can we do about them? How can we best fight climate change? How might tax or planning policy better <a href="https://revivingeconomicthinking.com/">promote</a> longer-term growth? How strong is the case for a national wealth fund, basic income or jobs guarantee? How should banks be regulated? Does inequality reduce growth and if so what can be done about it? Etc, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These questions, though, are not reflected in Westminster politics. It’s as if economics doesn’t <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2018/05/does-economics-matter.html">matter</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From one perspective, this is weird. Historically, politics has been dominated by economic issues: free trade vs protectionism in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century; whether to be on the gold standard or not; how to achieve full employment; whether to nationalize or privatize; how much planning; how to control inflation; what to do about productivity; and so on. The low salience of serious economics is unusual in a historic context therefore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s more, twelve years of flatlining real <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/a3wx/lms">wages</a> should have pushed economics up the agenda. We can afford to ignore the economy when it’s working well, but not when it isn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which poses the question. Why is there the disconnect Duncan notes? Here are some (non-exclusive possibilities):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- The transmission <a href="https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-knowledge-transmission-mechanism.html">mechanism</a> from academic economics to policy is broken. This is partly a supply-side problem. Academics are more concerned with bureaucracy and writing unreadable, unread and unreplicable journal articles than they are with communicating good ideas to the public. And even if they were interested, they’d be ignored by the media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- The rise of <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/03/against-retail-politics.html">retail</a> politics. Politicians – with a few exceptions – aren’t much interested in ideas. They need salesmen, not economists (or sociologists or philosophers for that matter). Who needs intellectuals when you have focus groups?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- Interests. Economic ideas gain political prominence if they promote, or at least don’t retard, the interests of powerful groups. Post-war full employment was feasible in part because Fordist capital needed mass markets of affluent workers. When, however, those affluent workers squeezed profits in the 70s, union-bashing became acceptable. So too did freer markets and lower taxes. Today, though, good economic ideas attack powerful interests. Landlords don’t want a land value tax. Bankers (or at least their bosses if not shareholders) don’t want higher capital requirements. And so on. It’s hard to imagine sensible economic policies which do not attack the interests of landlords or bankers. Sure, there’s still a section of capital whose interests are consonant with growth-promoting policies. But the message of Brexit is that this section is politically weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- Realignment. There’s a widespread view, shared by the <a href="https://electionreview.labourtogether.uk/">Labour</a> party, Matthew <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.12815">Goodwin</a> and Stephen Davies in his book, <em>The Politics and Economics of Brexit</em>, that we’ve seen a realignment of politics. The great divide is no longer about economics but culture: “somewhere” vs nowhere”, cosmopolitans vs nationalists”. Brexit might be the start of this new alignment not the end. If so, economics matters less for politics than it used to. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2b0cbe200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Brexit-protests-shutterstock" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2b0cbe200c img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec2b0cbe200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Brexit-protests-shutterstock" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which brings me to my beef. Isn’t it remarkable that, of all the times this realignment might have happened, it just happens to have come after years of capitalist stagnation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, not so remarkable. It corroborates the <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/bfriedman/pages/moral-consequences-economic-growth">finding</a> made by Ben Friedman in 2006, that hard economic times breed nationalism and intolerance. Many of those who remark upon the new realignment are guilty of a gross incuriosity: the fail to ask: might political preferences be endogenous, the result of socio-economic trends?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Herein lies a massive difference between now and the 70s. Back then, the Tories reacted to economic crisis by developing a new economic agenda. Thatcher could plausibly tell a lot of people: “vote Tory and you’ll get richer”. Enough, anyway, to win general elections. Her epigones, however, cannot do this. They have no ideas for economic regeneration – though whether this is because of their own intellectual shortcomings or economic reality is an open question. Instead, all they have is the fanning of the flames of nationalism. There’s more than one way to achieve hegemony.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do some rightists oppose mandatory face-coverings? Tory MP Desmond Swayne has called them a &quot;monstrous <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/watch-tory-mp-desmond-swayne-rails-against-monstrous-imposition-of-compulsory-face-masks-and-says-he-wont-go-shopping">imposition</a>&quot;, Peter Hitchens <a href="https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2020/07/peter-hitchens.html">says</a> they leave us &quot;muzzled in face-nappies&quot; and of course James Delingtwat and Laurence <a href="https://twitter.com/LozzaFox/status/1288102126460088325">Fox</a> have jumped on the bandwagon - although Mr Fox has at least the redeeming virtue of possessing some talent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&#39;t think the answer lies in the proposition that there&#39;s little evidence of masks&#39; effectiveness. For one thing, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-07-08-oxford-covid-19-study-face-masks-and-coverings-work-act-now">there</a> is. For another, risk is not merely a matter of facts but of feelings, and common sense says that masks reduce the risk of infection. And for a third, rightists are not always fastidious about following evidence. (Hint - the B-word).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I suspect something else is going on. Mask-wearing shows that the fulfilment of our preferences is not compossible, to use Leibnitz&#39;s word. My preference not to wear them (being a speccy four-eyes they steam up my glasses) conflicts with the shop-worker&#39;s preference to feel safer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, in some some just-so stories, such non-compossibility doesn&#39;t happen. In Adam Smith&#39;s fable of free markets his preference for dinner and the butcher&#39;s preference for a shilling are indeed compossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mask-wearing shows us that the world isn&#39;t always like this. Preferences conflict. And when they do, we leave the realm of perfect markets and enter politics. Politics is what happens when my neighbour wants a quiet night and I want a party. My initial thought, then, is that what we have here is an example of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b500640-867c-4b6b-8adf-31b4950f0012">libertarian</a> rightists being anti-politics. They fail to see that the fairytale libertarian world of compossible preferences is not always feasible, and rather than adapt their thinking they rail against politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this isn&#39;t quite right. Some anti-maskers are anti-libertarian. Mr Hitchens is a long-time campaigner against drug legalization, and Mr Swayne has <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2018-12-11a.167.5#g172.0">voted</a> to maintain the criminalization of cannabis use. Both therefore fail a litmus test of libertarianism. Conversely, some of the smarter libertarians, such as Ryan Bourne, are pro-mask.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn&#39;t, then, a matter of libertarianism. Instead, I suspect anti-masking is a continuation of a recent strand of mainstream Toryism - a refusal to see problems of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/">collective</a> action, whereby preferences are not compossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in 2012 there was a burst of panic-buying of petrol for fear of a strike by fuel drivers. David <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2012/03/camerons-consistent-error.html">Cameron</a> responded by saying: &quot;If there is an opportunity to top up your tank if a strike is potentially on the way, then it is a sensible thing if you are able to do that.&quot; But this exacerbated the panic. Cameron failed to see that preferences were not compossible. My preference for a full tank just in case of a strike conflicted with yours. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e959131e200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Johnosn" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e959131e200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e959131e200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Johnosn" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And this was not an isolated example. Quite the opposite. Tory-Lib Dem policy in 2010-15 was founded on just such an error. Preferences for &quot;sound public finances&quot; conflicted with firms&#39; and households desires to save. The upshot was weak growth and a failure of austerity to reduce government borrowing as much as hoped. That was the paradox of thrift. And incentivizing people to want to move off <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-reform-and-jobs-miracle">benefits</a> led not so much to higher employment as to tougher times for claimants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In cases such as these, preferences are not compossible. Sometimes, when we all act on our preferences, we end up collectively worse off. Wearing masks is the flipside of this: by acting against our preference and wearing them, we might end up collectively better off by having fewer infections and escaping lockdowns. I don&#39;t often praise him, but Mr Johnson is to be congratulated for seeing what his fellow Etonian did not, that the essence of politics is to solve collective action problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not all rightists, however, do grasp this fact. In failing to do so they are not so much being individually stupid as merely following one of the dafter trends in recent Tory politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I stress that word &quot;recent&quot;. Tories have not always been blind to the need for some people to make sacrifices for the greater good when preferences conflict. For decades, they&#39;ve urged tougher conditions for workers and claimants for the &quot;greater good.&quot;, When they themselves have to make the sacrifices, some of today&#39;s Tories get queasy. For them, sacrifices are for the little people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s as if they actually want to prove Corey Robin right, that Conservatism stands for no more that the <a href="https://coreyrobin.com/2014/06/30/why-go-after-women-and-workers-the-reactionary-mind-explains-it-all-for-you/">protection</a> of privilege.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the problems with being a Marxist is one so rarely gets intelligent criticism. So I was delighted to see Eric Lonergan’s thoughtful <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a> to my review of Angrynomics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In many ways. I agree with him. He’s right that there is a “vacuum of thought” about economics – a vacuum filled by snake-oil peddlers of nationalism. But this vacuum is much more evident in politics &amp; the MSM than it is among economics. Angrynomics itself is a treasure trove of policy ideas. If we add the work of people such as <a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/">Diane Coyle</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@ian.mulheirn">Ian Mulheirn</a>, <a href="https://www.geoffmulgan.com/blog">Geoff Mulgan</a>, <a href="https://radixuk.org/">Radix</a>, Stian <a href="https://revivingeconomicthinking.com/">Westlake</a> and Sam Bowman (among others) we are struck by the almighty chasm between the intellectual heft of centrists outside of politics with the vacuity of centrists within politics. This surely warns us that there are powerful filters which select against good ideas. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20264e2eab2f3200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Keynes" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20264e2eab2f3200d img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20264e2eab2f3200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Keynes" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eric’s also right that there is no equivalent today of Keynes or Friedman, men who provoked revolutions in economic policy. But this reflects the general <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2018/05/on-britains-intellectual-decline.html">decline</a> of the public intellectual – a decline we can at least partially attribute to the neoliberalization of academia and the media. If there were an equivalent today of Keynes, he would be snowed under by bureaucracy and under pressure to publish journal articles nobody would read except to show that their findings were unreplicable. And he certainly wouldn’t get a multi-part TV series to promote his ideas, as Milton Friedman got.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, but, but. Whilst I welcome new thinking such as Eric’s, this under-rates the utility of good old ideas, many of which are excluded by political forces. Take four examples:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- The case for higher bank capital ratios (supported by Eric) was <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691162386/the-bankers-new-clothes">made</a> convincingly by Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig. It’s not been adopted because of lobbying by bank executives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- Even mainstream economists (most obviously Simon Wren-Lewis) knew that post-2010 fiscal austerity was a stinking idea. Their thought did not gain sufficient political traction, in part because of the influence of what Simon calls <a href="https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2015/05/on-mediamacro.html">mediamacro</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- You can’t walk out of your house without tripping over somebody advocating a universal basic income. But we’re stuck with the cruel and inadequate Universal Credit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#0160;- We have strong evidence that greater worker <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2014/07/why-not-worker-control.html">ownership</a> and control can often raise productivity. But – despite the efforts of John McDonnell – this remains marginalized by the MSM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is one point where I think Eric hits the nail of the head. It’s that “the specific interests of ‘capital’ at the current juncture of history are very unclear.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is right in two senses, on top of the fact that (as Eric says) there can be a conflict between the interests of bosses and shareholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, what policies and institutions best increase profit rates?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1945 to the 1970s, the answer was full employment and wage-led growth. The promise of high demand encouraged investment in capital and innovation. But this broke down in the 70s, to be replaced by profit-led growth, characterised by efforts to raise profit margins by weakening labour. But as Michael Roberts shows, this did little to <a href="https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2020/07/25/a-world-rate-of-profit-a-new-approach/">restore</a> aggregate profit rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what’s the answer? Fordist mass-market capital might require wage-led growth. But extractive financialized capital would prefer low interest rates. What’s the balance of influence between the two? Does capital require low taxes and small government, or does it need bigger investment in infrastructure? Does it require deficit financing to produce high and stable growth, or does it (as Kalecki <a href="https://delong.typepad.com/kalecki43.pdf">thought (pdf)</a>) require “sound finance” to ensure that governments are dependent upon business confidence?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, to what extent does capital need greater <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2019/11/shoring-up-capitalism.html">legitimacy</a>? One reason for high top taxes and full employment after 1945 was that governments thought they needed to inoculate capitalism against the <a href="https://www.socialeurope.eu/did-socialism-keep-capitalism-equal">threat</a> of revolution – a threat that faded as the USSR weakened and collapsed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is now, though, an open question how much legitimacy now needs shoring up. (You can read Brexit as a project of legitimation at the expense of accumulation.) The fact that some companies are keen to greenwash or to pay <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/private-equity-blackstone-anti-racism-housing">lip-service</a> to the BLM movement suggest many feel the need to appease their critics. But how much further does capital need to grow? Would more redistributive taxes raise legitimacy and help stabilize demand, or would they reduce incentives to invest and capitalists’ sense of their own entitlements? Does a big state help stabilize demand and provide legitimacy, or does the need for profits require privatization – what David Harvey has <a href="https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5811/2707">called</a> “accumulation by dispossession”?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This are all open questions. Which is where there might be reasons for optimism. It might be possible to build an alliance of social democracy with the more progressive elements of capital to advance the sort of agenda Eric and I would both support. And I’d add that this would be something the left should also support, as the <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2013/07/the-transition-to-socialism.html">transition</a> to socialism will <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/05/the-brailsfordian-road-to-socialism.html">come</a> via social democracy. But that’s another argument…</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the pitfalls of growing old is that one is often befuddled by the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So it is with the reaction to the Intelligence Select Committee&#39;s report on Russian influence on UK politics. This has highlighted the fact that Russian oligarchs are using London to <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/russia-report-reveals-story-repeated-failure-successive-governments">launder</a> their dirty <a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/russia-report-says-putin-friends-donate-to-british-political-parties-1-6756097">reputations</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/russia-report-golden-visas">dirty</a> money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, I splutter, we&#39;ve all known this for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Laundromat">ages</a>, even decades: I&#39;ve been referring to Chelsea &quot;Football&quot; Club as the money launders for years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I have a similar reaction to many things. For example, several tenets of MMT - that sectoral balances matter, that its is banks that create money out of nothing, and that there&#39;s no financial constraint on government borrowing - <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/the-deficit-myth-a-review.html">strike</a> me as old hat*. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e957f50b200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="A-31961-1329562079.jpeg" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e957f50b200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e957f50b200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="A-31961-1329562079.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Equally, talk of heterodox economics such as the work of Kalecki, Robinson and Sraffa is for me like hearing Mel &amp; Kim: both provoke happy memories of things I&#39;d half-forgotten from the 80s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same&#39;s true of behavioural economics. I first came across this back in 1986 when I read Loomes and Sugden&#39;s paper on regret theory, published in 1982 (too early to be webbed!). And I read Kahneman and Tversky&#39;s collection of papers, <em>Judgment Under Uncertainty</em> in the early 90s - and even then I was late to the party, as it was published in 1982. And yet I&#39;m still surprised when people sometimes treat behavioural economics as something new and radical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all these ways, I&#39;m often baffled by folks telling me what I thought I&#39;ve known for years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#39;s going on here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One possibility is that it corroborates Max Planck&#39;s saying: science advances one funeral at a time. Heterodox and behavioural economics might be old but they&#39;ve been resisted by the neoclassical economic establishment for years - an establishment which (re)gained dominance from the 1980s onwards. It&#39;s only as its influence has waned that alternative ideas have begun to blossom (again). Economic ideas are prone to fashions, which come and go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another possibility, is that attention, like most other things, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">scarce</a> resource. We therefore conserve it by not paying attention to some things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Russian money-laundering, this lack of attention was of course incentivized - by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43299598%20">sticks</a> as well as carrots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But our attention ebbs and flows without external incentives. From the early 90s until 2010 we didn&#39;t need to think much about fiscal policy because it wasn&#39;t egregiously terrible, at least in the UK. It&#39;s only when the disaster of austerity began that we needed to think again about fiscal policy, which led some to discover and rehash the ideas of Keynes, Kalecki, Lerner and Beveridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, neoclassical DSGE models were tolerable during the &quot;Great Moderation&quot; but came into question after the 2008 crisis - especially as that crisis came just five years after Robert Lucas (the father of the new neoclassicism) <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/Taxes/Lucas%20priorities%20AER%2003.pdf">declared (pdf)</a> that &quot;the central problem of depression prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe, though, there&#39;s something else. I&#39;ve been stupid. I have systematically committed an error of judgement. This is the false consensus effect, a tendency to over-estimate the extent to which other people think like ourselves. My surprise at people discovering Russian money-laundering, MMT, or behavioural economics is like Remainers being surprised by the Brexit vote because nobody they knew supported Leave**. <br />Which. I suspect, contains two messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One is that there is a danger that the behavioural economics and cognitive biases project makes the same error as Homer Simpson: &quot;everyone is stupid except me&quot;. (In the case of the nudge agenda, this isn&#39;t a danger but a reality.) In truth, though, the projects should warn us that we are all prone to errors of judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mere knowledge of cognitive biases, however, is not sufficient guard against them: I&#39;ve known about the false consensus <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2014/10/on-false-consensus.html">effect</a> for years, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me falling into the trap. Bill Shankly had a brilliant insight when he told a young player: &quot;the trouble with you son is that your brains are all in your head.&quot; Mere head-knowledge is sometimes not enough. Rational thinking requires habits and, failing that, institutions that promote good thinking and select against bad - institutions we don&#39;t possess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* I&#39;ve no big issue with most of MMT&#39;s ideas. Many of its advocates, however, remind me of Sellars and Yeatman&#39;s view of the roundheads - right but repulsive: longwinded fanatical sectarians. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* It&#39;s also for this reason that people feel an urge to confess their crimes: they suspect that others know they&#39;ve done it and want to unburden themselves. The Catholic Church hasn&#39;t survived 2000 years without a keen grasp of psychology.</em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Picture the typical angry voter. If you’re like me, your image will not be a twentysomething saddled with huge student debt, extortionate rent and a dull job but rather some russet-trousered gammon with no real complaint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much as I liked it, this is one issue I have with Mark Blyth’s and Eric Lonergan’s <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/angrynomics/9781788212793"><em>Angrynomics</em></a>. “People have every right to be pissed off” they write, “but please, be pissed off about the right things.” For me, though, our politics is characterized by too little of what Eric calls “legitimate public anger” and too much tribal anger. (The book is written as a dialogue between Eric and Mark, which is nothing like as annoyingly twee as you might expect). <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec295dd3200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Angry" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec295dd3200c img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263ec295dd3200c-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Angry" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This, I suspect, reflects some important cognitive biases. One the one hand, <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/03/tolerating-inequality.html">several</a> of these cause people to accept injustice: a status quo bias, <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2011/02/inequality-unrest-adaptive-preferences.html">resignation</a>, the just world illusion and so on. But on the other, as Ben Friedman <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/bfriedman/pages/moral-consequences-economic-growth">showed</a>, recessions make us more intolerant of outsiders and cause increased solidarity with “our own” – hence the rise in tribal anger since the financial crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whilst I’m disappointed with their failure to explain why we have the wrong sort of anger, Blyth and Lonergan are surely bang right to see that many western economies have suffered a massive political failure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have an abject failure of policy. Rather than presenting a major programme of economic reform, the global political elite has offered nothing substantive, instead choosing either to jump on the bandwagon of nationalism or insist that nothing fundamental is wrong…The political classes - bereft of ideas – are now desperately peddling old ideologies and instincts, or pursuing bizarre distractions like Brexit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This problem is not confined to the UK and US. Blyth and Lonergan are rightly scathing about the response to the euro crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing I really like are their policy proposals. These are usually the weakest sections of many economics books, but not here. Tougher bank regulation, a National Wealth Fund (using low government borrowing costs to buy equities from which to pay dividends for all), dual interest rates and the option of central banks <a href="https://www.positivemoney.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Central-Bank-Capital-as-an-Instrument-of-Monetary-Policy-Hampl-2018.pdf">writing (pdf)</a> everybody a cheque are all fine ideas well advocated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, but, but. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from recent years it is that the quality of an idea and the chances of it being adopted by politicians are two different things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our problem is not a lack of good policy ideas. We’ve plenty of these: to Blyth and Lonergan’s list we might add a green new deal, citizens income, universal basic services, job guarantee and worker coops among others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, our problem is that our political-media system functions as a device for <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2018/08/our-broken-politics.html">selecting</a> against good ideas and in favour of charlatans and grifters. Like Blyth and Lonergan, politics and the media distinguish between righteous anger and tribal atavism – but they do so to favour the latter. And too many in the Labour party connive in this: it’s strange how “legitimate concerns” are always about immigration rather than poverty wages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m not sure, then, that the problem of anger in politics can be solved merely by economic policy ideas. These have little chance of adoption without a political revolution to establish <a href="https://medium.com/@pauliewaulie/why-i-think-you-should-read-save-democracy-abolish-voting-6d21aac6cc1b">institutions</a> and modes of <a href="https://medium.com/@Bickerrecord/from-rights-to-functions-third-wave-corbynism-the-habermasian-spirit-of-guild-socialism-part-1-a22ace1de2a2">debate</a> which select for good ideas rather than against them. We need, therefore, <a href="https://www.amacad.org/publication/twelve-key-findings-deliberative-democracy-research">forms</a> of deliberative <a href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2018/07/our-call-for-action-on-deliberative-democracy">democracy</a>. These – and I fear only these – would enable the sensible policy ideas of Lonergan and Blyth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this raises a question. What chance do we have of such reform, given that our existing institutions serve extractive capitalism so well by diverting anger away from its proper target?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: justify;">What do experts know? This question arises from the <a href="https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1282799720105213952">reposting</a> the other day of an exchange between Caprice and Dr Sarah Jarvis, wherein Caprice argued for an early lockdown and mask-wearing, only to be opposed by the doctor. In hindsight, it looks as if Caprice <a href="https://reaction.life/caprice-jeremy-vine-dr-sarah-jarvis-and-how-caprice-turned-out-to-be-sort-of-right-about-covid-19/">might</a> have been more correct. Which poses the question, for economists as much as other scientists: how should we talk to lay-people? Here are some suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, know what you <a href="https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/comment/2020/07/09/the-circle-of-our-competence/">know</a> and what you don’t. As Charlie Munger <a href="https://25iq.com/2012/12/22/charlie-munger-on-circle-of-competence-the-second-essential-filter/">said</a>, “it’s not a competency if you don’t know the edge of it.” Economists, for example, do not <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/predicting-economic-turning-points">know</a> how to forecast <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/How-Accurate-Are-Private-Sector-Forecasts-Cross-Country-Evidence-From-Consensus-Forecasts-of-3543">recessions</a>. We should admit this fact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In particular, we should know the difference between the map and the terrain. The doctor told Caprice: “Unless you have read every…statistical modelling paper that’s come out you cannot argue with me.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One problem here is that you should not close down debate by appealing to expertise or credentials. The only expertise that matters is that you can demonstrate. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e956d554200b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Caprice" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451cbef69e20263e956d554200b img-responsive" src="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451cbef69e20263e956d554200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Caprice" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another problem is that it poses the question rightly <a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/second_thoughts_on_economics_rules_june_2018.pdf">raised (pdf)</a> by Dani Rodrik: how do we choose which model to apply to which bit of reality? Even today, there is much that’s not known about Covid-19. The question of which model to chose to describe its progress was therefore one on which scientists should have been humble&#0160; - certainly more so than Dr Jarvis. When you don’t know what to do, erring on the side of caution – an early lockdown in this case – is not unreasonable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One example of this problem in economics is that we had a good model of how globalization creates gains from trade and hence potential Pareto improvements. This model, however, over-estimated the ability of resources to shift to new occupations. Instead, as Banerjee and Duflo wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When bad news arrives in the form of greater competition from outside, instead of embracing it and moving resources to their best possible use, there is a tendency to hunker down and hope the problem will go away on its own. Workers are laid off, retiring workers are not replaced, and wages start to drift down. (<em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em>, p65)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Economists therefore under-weighted the prevalence (and anger) of the “left-behind” – which gave us Trump and Brexit. Our talk of GDP growth invited the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/blunt-heckler-economists-failing-us-booming-britain-gdp-london">reply</a>: “That’s your bloody GDP. Not ours.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expertise, especially in the sense of a command of theoretical models, can blind us to ground <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2016/12/an-appeal-for-ground-truth.html">truth</a>. And lay-people sometimes know this better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can also cause us to under-estimate the importance of <a href="https://infed.org/mobi/michael-polanyi-and-tacit-knowledge/">tacit</a> knowledge. Sure, Caprice has no book-learning of epistemology, but she had a hunch that something big was needed. And tacit knowledge is important. Entrepreneurship rests upon hunches that new processes are possible or that new products are wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This mix of ground truth and gut feel means we should listen to lay people. This is especially true of the totality of them when the conditions are fulfilled for there to be wisdom in crowds. Consumer <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/boe/boeewp/204.html">spending</a> relative to wealth can help <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr77.html">predict</a> equity returns, for example, because aggregate spending embodies the dispersed ground truth and gut feels people have about the future. Experts lack such knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In saying all this, I’m echoing a point <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/15bb6522-04ac-11e1-91d9-00144feabdc0#axzz1cpqnb61Z">made</a> by William Easterly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The experts are as prone to cognitive biases as the rest of us. Those at the top will be overly confident in their ability to predict the system-wide effects of paternalistic policy-making – and the combination of democratic politics and market economics is precisely the kind of complex and spontaneous order that does not lend itself to expert intuition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experts must guard against over-confidence. Just because you know more than the lay person does not mean you know it all, or even that you know enough. They must also be aware of groupthink and deformation professionelle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what do experts know that lay people don’t?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2016/01/not-connecting.html">Connections</a>. That’s what. Zeev Kril and David Leiser show that lay people are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2677659">terrible</a> at making connections and identifying causal links. People didn’t blame fiscal austerity for low returns on their savings for example; wrongly believe the effects of “fiscal prudence” are similar to an individual’s prudence; and wrongly blame <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/02/immigrants-as-scapegoats.html">immigrants</a> for a weak jobs market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s the job of experts, then, to show that social science is often not common sense: for example, behaviour that’s sensible for an individual might be bad for us collectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I’m proposing here is a sort of (loose) division of labour. Experts know explanations and (sometimes) useful aggregate facts. But they often don’t know the future or ground truth. We should respect the division of labour. Whether we have the political and media institutions that do so is, however, another matter.</p>
